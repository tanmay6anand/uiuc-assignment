I have created a bash script assuming you are using linux or macOS

You can use following command to run the app to use input file training.txt in the directory as input
```console
./script.sh app
```

or if you want to manually


To run the main.py use command:
```console
python app.py
```
To run the unit tests file unittest.py use command:
```console
python -m unittest
```
or 
```console
./script.sh test
```
to delete the generated files use command

```console
./script.sh clear
```

Note: 
If the script is not working don't forget to give it execute permission

```console
chmod +x script.sh
```
